# Quick Summary: Stacking Improvements

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. Direct Drop in Stack Mode
**Before:** Had to hover and wait for green indicator  
**After:** Just drop anywhere on a valid stack - instant stacking!

```
Stack Mode:
  Drag item → Drop on stack → ✅ Stacks immediately
  (No hover required!)
```

---

### 2. Width Validation (Physical Realism)
**Before:** Could stack wide items on narrow items (unstable)  
**After:** Only allows stable stacks (top ≤ bottom width)

```
✅ ALLOWED (Stable):
  [50mm Can]
  [80mm Bottle] ← Bottom
  
❌ BLOCKED (Unstable):
  [80mm Bottle]
  [50mm Can] ← Bottom
```

---

## How It Works

### Direct Stacking:
```typescript
// In Stack Mode, when you drop on a stack:
1. Check if target is valid (validation.validStackTargetIds)
2. If yes → Stack immediately
3. If no → Show red feedback
```

### Width Check:
```typescript
// During validation:
const bottomItem = stack[stack.length - 1];
if (draggedItem.width > bottomItem.width) {
  ❌ Invalid - too wide to stack here
}
```

## Visual Feedback

### Valid Stack (Green):
- ✅ Width OK
- ✅ Height OK  
- ✅ Shows: "✓ STACK HERE"

### Invalid Stack (Red):
- ❌ Width too large OR Height too tall
- ❌ Shows: "✗ CANNOT STACK"

## Examples

### Example 1: Pyramid Stacking ✅
```
[Small - 50mm]
[Medium - 70mm]
[Large - 90mm] ← Bottom

Result: ✅ All stacks work (pyramid shape)
```

### Example 2: Inverted Pyramid ❌
```
[Large - 90mm]
[Medium - 70mm]
[Small - 50mm] ← Bottom

Result: ❌ Can't stack 90mm on 50mm base
```

### Example 3: Equal Widths ✅
```
[Can - 66mm]
[Can - 66mm]
[Can - 66mm] ← Bottom

Result: ✅ Equal widths allowed
```

## Testing

**Test Direct Drop:**
1. Stack Mode → Drag item → Drop on stack (no hover)
2. Should stack instantly if valid

**Test Width:**
1. Try stacking wide item on narrow item
2. Should show red "✗ CANNOT STACK"
3. Try narrow item on wide item
4. Should show green "✓ STACK HERE"

## Files Modified

1. **validation.ts** - Added width check
2. **planogramEditor.tsx** - Added direct drop logic

**Lines Changed:** ~16 lines total

**Risk:** 🟡 Medium (new constraint may affect existing data)

**Status:** ✅ Complete and ready to test!
