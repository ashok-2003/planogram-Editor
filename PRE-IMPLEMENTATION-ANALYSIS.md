# Pre-Implementation Impact Analysis
## Think Before We Code! 🧠

---

## 🎯 Goal
Unify store and persistence logic to fix race conditions, add per-layout drafts, and simplify component.

---

## 🔍 Current State Analysis

### 1. What's Working Now?
✅ Basic CRUD operations (add, move, delete items)
✅ Undo/Redo functionality (in memory only)
✅ Layout switching (but loses data)
✅ Auto-save to localStorage (single draft only)
✅ Draft restoration (but buggy with race conditions)
✅ Drag and drop
✅ Validation rules

### 2. What's Broken?
❌ Race condition: Draft restoration gets overwritten by useEffect
❌ Layout switching: Overwrites previous layout's draft
❌ Undo/redo history NOT persisted (lost on refresh)
❌ Single storage key causes data loss when switching layouts
❌ Complex component with 4 useEffect hooks hard to debug

---

## 🧪 Impact Analysis - What Will Break?

### Phase 1-3: Adding State & Signatures
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW

**What we're doing:**
- Adding new properties to store interface
- Adding empty localStorage utilities
- Adding action signatures (not implemented yet)

**Potential Issues:**
- TypeScript will complain about unimplemented actions (EXPECTED)
- Store will have extra unused properties (HARMLESS)
- Component won't use new state yet (SAFE)

**What could break:**
- Nothing! These are additions only
- App should continue working exactly as before

**Mitigation:**
- Don't import new actions in component yet
- Keep old persistence.ts working for now
- Verify app still runs after each phase

---

### Phase 4-7: Implementing New Actions
**Risk Level:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**What we're doing:**
- Implementing 6 new store actions
- These actions will use localStorage utilities

**Potential Issues:**
1. **LocalStorage conflicts:**
   - New key pattern: `planogram-draft-{layoutId}`
   - Old key pattern: `planogram-draft`
   - Both will exist temporarily (OK - we'll clean up later)

2. **Double saves:**
   - Old component still has auto-save useEffect
   - New store will also auto-save
   - Could cause double writes (WASTEFUL but not breaking)

3. **State inconsistency:**
   - Component still using old persistence.ts
   - Store has new persistence actions
   - If both run, might conflict (UNLIKELY - component not using new actions yet)

**What could break:**
- Nothing critical! New actions won't be called yet
- localStorage might have both old and new keys (can clean up)

**Mitigation:**
- Test each action in browser console manually
- Verify localStorage structure
- Don't connect to component until all actions work

---

### Phase 8: Updating pushToHistory
**Risk Level:** 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH

**What we're doing:**
- Adding `currentLayoutId` parameter to `pushToHistory`
- Triggering auto-save on every history change
- Updating ALL 8-9 calls to `pushToHistory`

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Missing currentLayoutId:**
   - If any action is called before `initializeLayout`, `currentLayoutId` will be null
   - Auto-save won't trigger (OK - intentional)

2. **Double auto-save:**
   - Component's useEffect still saves
   - pushToHistory now saves too
   - Will save twice on every action (WASTEFUL but not breaking)

3. **TypeScript errors:**
   - If we miss updating ANY call to `pushToHistory`, TypeScript error
   - Easy to fix (add the parameter)

**What could break:**
- Undo/redo might have issues if we miss a call
- Auto-save might not work if currentLayoutId is null

**Mitigation:**
- Search for ALL instances of `pushToHistory(`
- Use TypeScript to find missing parameters
- Test undo/redo after changes
- Keep old component auto-save running until Phase 9

---

### Phase 9-10: Simplifying Component
**Risk Level:** 🔴 HIGH - This is the BIG change!

**What we're doing:**
- Removing old persistence imports
- Deleting 5 state variables
- Deleting 4 useEffect hooks
- Deleting 3 callback handlers
- Adding new store state access
- Updating JSX to use new actions

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Component won't initialize:**
   - If `initializeLayout` doesn't work, component won't load
   - Need to ensure it's called properly in new useEffect

2. **RestorePrompt won't show:**
   - Depends on `hasPendingDraft` flag from store
   - If initialization logic is wrong, prompt won't appear

3. **Layout switching breaks:**
   - New `switchLayout` action must work perfectly
   - If it fails, can't switch between layouts

4. **Auto-save stops working:**
   - Relying entirely on `pushToHistory` auto-save now
   - If that's broken, no saves happen

5. **JSX references old variables:**
   - If we miss updating any JSX that uses old state
   - Runtime errors in browser

**What WILL break:**
- Old persistence.ts functions won't be called anymore
- Old useEffect hooks won't run
- Old handlers won't exist
- Component structure changes significantly

**Mitigation:**
- Test in browser after every sub-phase
- Keep browser console open for errors
- Test all user flows:
  - Add item
  - Delete item
  - Undo/redo
  - Layout switch
  - Page refresh
  - Draft restore

---

### Phase 11: New SyncIndicator
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW

**What we're doing:**
- Replacing SaveIndicator component
- New component with better UI

**Potential Issues:**
- Component props changed (syncStatus vs isSaving)
- If parent doesn't pass correct props, won't render

**What could break:**
- UI might look different (EXPECTED - it's an improvement)
- Manual sync button behavior changes (uses store action now)

**Mitigation:**
- Verify component renders
- Test manual sync button
- Check sync status transitions

---

### Phase 12: Cleanup
**Risk Level:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**What we're doing:**
- Deleting `lib/persistence.ts`
- Final testing

**Potential Issues:**
- If we missed any imports from persistence.ts, TypeScript error
- If old draft format exists in localStorage, might not load

**What could break:**
- App won't compile if imports still reference deleted file

**Mitigation:**
- Search entire codebase for `from '@/lib/persistence'`
- Check TypeScript errors before deleting file
- Keep file backed up until testing complete

---

## 🚨 Critical Dependency Chain

This is the order things MUST work:

```
1. localStorage utilities work
   ↓
2. initializeLayout() reads from localStorage correctly
   ↓
3. Component calls initializeLayout() on mount
   ↓
4. hasPendingDraft flag set correctly
   ↓
5. RestorePrompt shows based on flag
   ↓
6. restoreDraft() action clears flag
   ↓
7. pushToHistory() triggers auto-save
   ↓
8. All store actions call pushToHistory()
   ↓
9. switchLayout() saves current before loading new
   ↓
10. Everything persists across refresh
```

**If ANY step fails, the whole chain breaks!**

## 🛡️ Safety Measures

### Before Starting:
- [ ] Commit current working code
- [ ] Create backup branch
- [ ] Document current behavior
- [ ] Note any existing bugs

### During Implementation:
- [ ] Implement one phase at a time
- [ ] Test after EVERY phase
- [ ] Keep browser console open
- [ ] Check TypeScript errors continuously
- [ ] Don't proceed if errors appear

### Testing Strategy:
- [ ] Test in isolation (store actions directly)
- [ ] Test in integration (component using actions)
- [ ] Test user flows (real interactions)
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty state, expired drafts)

---

## 🧩 Dependencies & Order

### Must Complete in Order:
1. **Phases 1-3** → Provides structure
2. **Phases 4-7** → Implements actions (depends on Phase 2 utilities)
3. **Phase 8** → Auto-save (depends on Phase 4-7 actions)
4. **Phases 9-10** → Component (depends on ALL previous phases)
5. **Phase 11** → UI component (depends on Phase 9-10)
6. **Phase 12** → Cleanup (depends on everything working)

### Cannot Skip:
- ❌ Can't do Phase 9 before Phase 8 (no auto-save)
- ❌ Can't do Phase 10 before Phase 9 (component not set up)
- ❌ Can't do Phase 12 before testing (might need rollback)

## 🎲 Risk Matrix

| Phase | Impact | Likelihood | Overall Risk | Can Rollback? |
|-------|--------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1-3 | Low | Low | 🟢 Low | ✅ Easy |
| 4-7 | Medium | Low | 🟡 Medium | ✅ Easy |
| 8 | High | Medium | 🟠 Medium-High | ⚠️ Moderate |
| 9-10 | Very High | Medium | 🔴 High | ⚠️ Difficult |
| 11 | Low | Low | 🟢 Low | ✅ Easy |
| 12 | Medium | Low | 🟡 Medium | ❌ Hard (file deleted) |

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

### If Phase 1-3 Fails:
1. Revert store.ts changes
2. No impact on component

### If Phase 4-8 Fails:
1. Keep new state properties
2. Remove action implementations
3. Component still uses old logic (works fine)

### If Phase 9-10 Fails:
1. Revert component changes
2. Re-add old useEffect hooks
3. Re-add old imports
4. Keep store changes (not used by component)

### If Phase 11 Fails:
1. Revert to old SaveIndicator
2. Everything else still works

### If Phase 12 Fails:
1. Don't delete persistence.ts yet
2. Fix remaining imports
3. Delete when safe
