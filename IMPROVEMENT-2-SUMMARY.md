# Improvement #2: Undo/Redo Functionality ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **History System in Zustand Store**
- Added `history` array to track all refrigerator states
- Added `historyIndex` to track current position in history
- Implemented `saveToHistory()` helper function that:
  - Removes future history when making new changes
  - Limits history to last 50 states (prevents memory issues)
  - Deep clones state to prevent reference issues

### 2. **Undo/Redo Actions**
- **`undo()`**: Moves back in history, restores previous state
- **`redo()`**: Moves forward in history, restores next state
- Both actions show toast notifications for success/failure
- Both clear selected item to prevent stale selections

### 3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Ctrl+Z** (or Cmd+Z on Mac): Undo
- **Ctrl+Y** (or Cmd+Shift+Z on Mac): Redo  
- **Delete**: Delete selected item
- All shortcuts prevent default browser behavior

### 4. **UI Controls**
- Added Undo/Redo buttons next to Mode Toggle
- Buttons show disabled state when no history available
- Buttons display hover tooltips with keyboard shortcuts
- Icons show directional arrows for visual clarity
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

### 5. **Integration with All Actions**
All state-modifying actions now save to history:
- ✅ `removeItemsById` (delete items)
- ✅ `duplicateAndAddNew` (duplicate item as new)
- ✅ `duplicateAndStack` (duplicate and stack)
- ✅ `replaceSelectedItem` (replace with different SKU)
- ✅ `addItemFromSku` (drag SKU from palette)
- ✅ `moveItem` (move between rows)
- ✅ `reorderStack` (reorder within same row)
- ✅ `stackItem` (stack items vertically)

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/store.ts`**
   - Added history state and actions
   - Updated all mutation actions to save history
   - Added `saveToHistory()` helper function

2. **`app/planogram/components/planogramEditor.tsx`**
   - Added keyboard event listeners
   - Added Undo/Redo UI buttons
   - Added `canUndo` and `canRedo` computed values

## Technical Details

### History Management
- **Branching History**: When you make a change after undoing, all "future" history is discarded
- **Memory Optimization**: Only keeps last 50 states (configurable)
- **Deep Cloning**: Uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to prevent reference issues

### State Flow
```
Action → Save Current State → Modify → Update History Index
Undo → Move Index Back → Restore State
Redo → Move Index Forward → Restore State
```

## User Benefits

1. **Mistake Recovery**: Users can undo any action
2. **Experimentation**: Try different layouts without fear
3. **Professional UX**: Standard keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear button states and toast messages
5. **No Data Loss**: History preserved across 50 states

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Undo with empty history (shows error toast)
- [x] Redo with no future states (shows error toast)
- [x] Undo after adding item (item removed)
- [x] Redo after undo (item restored)
- [x] Multiple undos in sequence
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts work (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- [x] Button disabled states update correctly
- [x] History cleared when making new changes after undo

## Next Steps
