# Smart Stacking Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Products Now Stack Automatically** ✅
- Drag any product onto another product → It will try to stack!
- **Green glow** = Can stack here
- **Red ring** = Can't stack here
- No need to switch modes anymore

### 2. **Smooth Cursor Following** ✅
- Fixed cursor lag during drag
- Product follows cursor closely
- Added smooth drop animation
- Better visual feedback

### 3. **Simplified Feedback** ✅
- Removed overwhelming messages
- Just simple colors:
  - **Green** = Good to stack
  - **Red** = Can't stack
  - **No extra text** cluttering the screen

## How It Works Now

### Adding Products
1. **Drag from left palette** → Drop on shelf
2. Product appears where you drop it ✅

### Stacking Products
1. **Drag product A** onto **product B**
2. See **green glow** if it can stack
3. See **red ring** if it can't stack
4. Drop → It stacks automatically! ✅

### Moving Products
1. **Drag product** between other products
2. See **blue line** where it will go
3. Drop → It moves there ✅

## What Changed in Code

### 1. Fixed Drag Preview (planogramEditor.tsx)
```tsx
<DragOverlay dropAnimation={{ duration: 200 }}>
  <div className="cursor-grabbing opacity-90 scale-105">
    <ItemComponent item={activeItem} />
  </div>
</DragOverlay>
```
- Smoother cursor following
- Better drop animation
- No more lag

### 2. Simplified Visual Feedback (stack.tsx)
```tsx
// Green glow for valid stacking
{showValidStackFeedback && (
  <div className="bg-green-400/20 ring-2 ring-green-500" />
)}

// Red ring for invalid stacking
{showInvalidStackFeedback && (
  <div className="bg-red-500/10 ring-2 ring-red-500" />
)}
```
- Clean, simple colors
- No text badges
- Just visual indicators

### 3. Smart Detection (validation.ts)
- Automatically checks if stacking is possible
- Works in any mode
- No need to think about it!

## Testing
