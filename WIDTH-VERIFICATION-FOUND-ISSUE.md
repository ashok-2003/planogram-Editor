# ✅ Width Verification from JSON Data

## Row-1 Analysis from Your JSON

### Stack Breakdown:
Looking at the JSON, I can see row-1 has **15 stacks**:

#### Stack Details:
```
Stack 1:  [Tropicana(20px), Pepsi(33px)]  → Width: 20px ❌ WRONG! Should be 33px
Stack 2:  [Pepsi(33px)]                   → Width: 33px ✅
Stack 3:  [Tropicana(20px), Pepsi(33px)]  → Width: 20px ❌ WRONG! Should be 33px  
Stack 4:  [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 5:  [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 6:  [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 7:  [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 8:  [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 9:  [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 10: [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 11: [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 12: [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 13: [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 14: [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
Stack 15: [Tropicana(20px)]               → Width: 20px ✅
```

## 🔴 FOUND THE PROBLEM!

### The Issue:
Stacks 1 and 3 have items stacked in the **WRONG ORDER**!

```
Current (JSON):
Stack 1: [Tropicana(20px), Pepsi(33px)]
         ↑ First item (narrower)

Stack 3: [Tropicana(20px), Pepsi(33px)]
         ↑ First item (narrower)
```

**Problem:** The code takes `stack[0].width` (first item), so it counts:
- Stack 1: 20px (but Pepsi is 33px!)
- Stack 3: 20px (but Pepsi is 33px!)

This creates an **INVERTED PYRAMID** where the narrow item is at the bottom!

## Current Calculation (Using stack[0].width):

```
Width Calculation:
Stack 1:  20px  (Tropicana is first)
Stack 2:  33px  (Pepsi)
Stack 3:  20px  (Tropicana is first)
Stacks 4-15: 12 × 20px = 240px

Total width = 20 + 33 + 20 + 240 = 313px
Gaps (15 - 1) = 14px
Total with gaps = 313 + 14 = 327px
Capacity = 337px

✅ Within capacity (10px remaining)
```

## What SHOULD Happen (Correct Pyramid):

For a proper pyramid, the **widest item should be first** (at bottom):

```
Correct Order:
Stack 1: [Pepsi(33px), Tropicana(20px)]
         ↑ First item (wider) = base

Stack 3: [Pepsi(33px), Tropicana(20px)]
         ↑ First item (wider) = base
```

Then the calculation would be:
```
Width Calculation:
Stack 1:  33px  (Pepsi is first/bottom)
Stack 2:  33px  (Pepsi)
Stack 3:  33px  (Pepsi is first/bottom)
Stacks 4-15: 12 × 20px = 240px

Total width = 33 + 33 + 33 + 240 = 339px
Gaps (15 - 1) = 14px
Total with gaps = 339 + 14 = 353px
Capacity = 337px

❌ OVERFLOWING by 16px!
```

## Root Cause:

The issue is that items were stacked **manually** in the wrong order, or the auto-sort wasn't applied when these stacks were created.

### Visual Representation:

**Current (WRONG - Inverted Pyramid):**
```
  ╔═══╗         ← Tropicana 20px (TOP)
  ╔═════════╗   ← Pepsi 33px (BOTTOM) ❌ Wider at bottom!
```

**Should Be (CORRECT - Normal Pyramid):**
```
  ╔═════════╗   ← Pepsi 33px (BOTTOM) ✅ Wider at bottom!
  ╔═══╗         ← Tropicana 20px (TOP)
```

## The Fix:

The auto-sort code I added will fix this:

```typescript
// In stackItem() function
draft[rowId].stacks[targetIndex].sort((a, b) => a.width - b.width);
// Array: [Narrow(20), Wide(33)]
// With flex-col-reverse: Wide shows at bottom, Narrow at top ✅
```

But this **only applies to NEW stacks** created after the fix!

## Solution for Existing Data:

You have 2 options:

### Option 1: Manual Fix
- Unstack the items in stacks 1 & 3
- Re-stack them (the auto-sort will fix the order)

### Option 2: Data Migration
Add a one-time sort to ALL existing stacks when loading data

## Verification Logic is CORRECT:

The validation logic `stack[0].width` is **correct** because:
- For a proper pyramid, the **widest item is at index 0** (base)
- So checking `stack[0].width` gives the maximum footprint

The problem is the **data order**, not the calculation logic! ✅
