# Improvement #3: localStorage Persistence & Auto-Save (COMPLETED)

## 📋 Overview
Implemented layout-aware localStorage persistence with auto-save functionality and manual save controls.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Layout-Aware Persistence
- **Context-aware saving**: Each refrigerator layout saves its state separately
- **Layout ID tracking**: Saves include metadata about which layout they belong to
- **Smart restore**: Only shows restore prompt for the current layout's saved state

### 2. Auto-Save System
- **Debounced saving**: 1-second debounce to avoid excessive writes
- **Automatic triggers**: Saves whenever refrigerator state changes
- **Non-intrusive**: Works silently in the background

### 3. Manual Save Controls
- **Save Now Button**: Explicit save action with visual feedback
- **Last Saved Indicator**: Shows time since last save (e.g., "2 minutes ago")
- **Success Toast**: Confirmation when manual save completes

### 4. Smart Restore Prompt
- **Difference detection**: Only shows if saved state differs from initial layout
- **Layout-specific**: Only restores drafts for the current refrigerator model
- **User choice**: User can restore or dismiss the saved draft
- **Time display**: Shows when the draft was last saved

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Storage Structure
```typescript
interface SavedDraft {
  refrigerator: Refrigerator;  // The actual refrigerator state
  layoutId: string;             // Which layout this belongs to (e.g., 'g-26c')
  timestamp: string;            // ISO timestamp of save
}
```

### Key Functions

#### `savePlanogramDraft(refrigerator, layoutId)`
- Saves refrigerator state with layout context
- Stores as JSON in localStorage
- Includes timestamp for "last saved" display

#### `loadPlanogramDraft(layoutId?)`
- Loads saved draft for specific layout
- Returns null if no draft or wrong layout
- Deep clones to ensure fresh state

#### `isDraftDifferent(currentState, layoutId)`
- Compares current state with saved draft
- Uses JSON serialization for deep comparison
- Layout-aware checking

#### `hasSavedDraft(layoutId?)`
- Checks if a draft exists for a layout
- Used to show/hide restore prompt
- Fast boolean check

#### `debouncedSavePlanogram(refrigerator, layoutId)`
- 1-second debounce for auto-save
- Prevents excessive localStorage writes
- Cancels previous pending saves

### UI Components

#### `SaveIndicator`
```tsx
<SaveIndicator 
  lastSaveTime={lastSaveTime} 
  onManualSave={handleManualSave} 
/>
```
- Green checkmark with "Last saved: X ago"
- Blue "Save Now" button
- Clean, non-intrusive design

#### `RestorePrompt`
```tsx
<RestorePrompt 
  lastSaveTime={lastSaveTime}
  onRestore={handleRestoreDraft}
  onDismiss={handleDismissDraft}
/>
```
- Appears at top of screen
- Animated entry/exit
- Shows when draft was saved
- Restore or Dismiss options

## 🔄 User Flows

### Flow 1: Auto-Save While Working
1. User adds/moves items in refrigerator
2. After 1 second of inactivity, auto-save triggers
3. "Last saved: just now" appears in SaveIndicator
4. No interruption to user's work

### Flow 2: Restore on Page Load
1. User refreshes page or returns later
2. If saved draft differs from initial layout, RestorePrompt appears
3. User clicks "Restore" → items reappear in refrigerator
4. User clicks "Dismiss" → starts fresh with empty layout

### Flow 3: Manual Save
1. User clicks "Save Now" button
2. Current state saves immediately
3. Success toast: "Planogram saved!"
4. "Last saved: just now" updates

### Flow 4: Switching Layouts
1. User switches from Layout A to Layout B
2. Auto-save stores Layout B state separately
3. If user switches back to Layout A:
   - Sees restore prompt if Layout A has saved changes
   - Layout B state remains saved separately
4. Each layout maintains independent state

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Users
- **No lost work**: Auto-save prevents data loss
- **Peace of mind**: Visual confirmation of saves
- **Flexibility**: Manual save for important milestones
- **Context-aware**: Each layout tracked separately

### For Developers
- **Clean separation**: Layout-aware persistence
- **Performance**: Debounced saves reduce writes
- **Debugging**: Console logs for troubleshooting
- **Maintainable**: Well-structured persistence layer

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Files
1. **`lib/persistence.ts`**
   - Added `SavedDraft` interface
   - Layout-aware save/load functions
   - Debounced auto-save
   - Timestamp tracking

2. **`app/planogram/components/planogramEditor.tsx`**
   - `SaveIndicator` component
   - `RestorePrompt` component
   - `handleRestoreDraft()` with deep cloning
   - `handleManualSave()` with toast feedback
   - Auto-save effect with layout context
   - Restore prompt detection on mount

## 🐛 Debugging Features

### Console Logging
When restore is triggered:
```
🔄 Restoring draft for layout: g-26c
📦 Saved draft data: { ... }
✅ Restored state: { ... }
🔍 Current store state after restore: { ... }
```

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all persistence functions
- Graceful fallbacks if localStorage unavailable
- Clear error messages in console
- Toast notifications for user-facing errors

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multiple draft slots**: Save/load named drafts
2. **Export/Import**: Download drafts as JSON files
3. **Sync across devices**: Cloud backup option
4. **Draft history**: Keep last 5 versions per layout
5. **Compression**: Reduce localStorage size
6. **Conflict resolution**: Handle multiple tabs

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Incremental saves**: Only save changed rows
2. **IndexedDB**: Use for larger storage capacity
3. **Service Worker**: Offline-first approach
4. **Delta encoding**: Store only changes

## 📊 Testing Checklist

- [x] Auto-save triggers after changes
- [x] Manual save button works
- [x] Restore prompt appears when appropriate
- [x] Layout switching preserves separate states
- [x] "Last saved" time updates correctly
- [x] Dismiss clears saved draft
- [x] Console logs provide debug info
- [x] Toast notifications work
- [ ] Restore actually restores items ⚠️ (PARTIAL - needs debugging)

## 🎉 Result

Users can now:
- ✅ Work confidently without losing progress
- ✅ See when their work was last saved
- ✅ Manually save at important moments
- ⚠️ Restore previous work after page refresh (partial - prompt shows but items not rendering)
- ✅ Switch between layouts without mixing state
- ✅ Get clear feedback on save operations

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Restore Not Rendering Items
- **Problem**: Restore prompt appears and save/load works, but items don't render on refrigerator
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Possible causes**:
  - State update not triggering re-render
  - Timing issue with component lifecycle
  - Deep equality check preventing update
- **Next steps**: Debug state flow and component rendering
