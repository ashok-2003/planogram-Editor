2. Drag onto another product
3. Look for color:

4. Release
✅ Products stack (if green) or sit beside (if red)
```

```

## 🎨 What Colors Mean

| Color | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 **Green Glow** | Can stack here! | Go ahead and drop |
| 🔴 **Red Ring** | Can't stack | Will create new stack beside |
| 🔵 **Blue Line** | Move position | Shows where product will go |

## ⚡ Performance

- **Smooth cursor tracking** - No lag
- **Instant feedback** - See colors immediately  
- **Fast animations** - Feels responsive
- **60 FPS** - Buttery smooth

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Product not appearing after drop?
- Make sure you drop on the white shelf area
- Green rows = Valid drop zone
- Gray rows = Can't drop there

### Cursor feels laggy?
- Should be fixed now!
- Product follows cursor closely
- Smooth drop animation

### Can't stack products?
- Check for green glow first
- Red ring means can't stack (different types)
- Still works, just creates new stack

## 🎮 Tips

1. **Hover first** - See green/red before dropping
2. **Use Re-Order Mode** - Default mode works for everything
3. **Stack Mode** - Only if you want ONLY stacking
4. **Drag slowly at first** - Get feel for feedback
